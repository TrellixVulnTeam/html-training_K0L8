                Nature of Sociological Theories</p>


            <h3>In short, sociological theory has the following characteristics:</h3>


            <p>A theory is a well-defined systematic symbolic terminology and free from the inevitability of fact,
                theory-making is a creative achievement and involves leaping beyond the limits of evidence. 2 . Theories
                are expressed in terms of well-defined concepts and logically interrelated propositions. 3. The nature
                of a theory is systematic or provisional, it is always open to new insights and amendments on the basis
                of evidence. It is neither necessary nor required to have a final formulation for any sociological
                theory. 4. It is initially verifiable, that is, it is consistent with the body of known facts and
                available evidence. 5. It is a systematic formulation that aims at harmonizing the needs of the
                humanistic tradition and the demands of the scientific tradition. 6. Principles arise out of human
                conduct, that is, social principles are relative to time.</p>
